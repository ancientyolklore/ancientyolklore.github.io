# Ancient Yolk Lore

A GitHub Pages site powered by Jekyll. It contains:

- A home page that highlights the latest blog posts and documentation.
- An about page with project background.
- A blog backed by `_posts/` with example articles.
- A documentation collection under `_docs/` with a navigation sidebar.

## Local Development

1. Install Ruby 3.1+ and Bundler.
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Run the site locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Visit `http://localhost:4000` to preview changes.

Changes merged into `main` will be published automatically by GitHub Pages.
