This is the first post on the Ancient Yolk Lore project journal. Expect regular notes about what we are building, what we are learning, and how you can contribute.

To get started locally, read the **Getting Started** guide in the documentation section. It walks through cloning the repo, installing dependencies, and spinning up a development server.

Thanks for visitingï¿½more to come soon!
