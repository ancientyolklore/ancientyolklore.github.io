Today we added a complete Jekyll structure to power the GitHub Pages site. Highlights include:

- A custom navigation header that links to the home page, blog, about page, and docs.
- A documentation collection with a sidebar for easy browsing.
- Fresh styling to tie everything together.

If you want to make your own changes, check out the **Project Structure** doc for pointers on where things live.
