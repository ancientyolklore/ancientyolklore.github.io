We are planning several improvements over the next few weeks:

1. **Automated testing** for Markdown links and front matter.
2. **Theme enhancements** to add a dark mode toggle and richer typography.
3. **Contributor guides** covering pull request workflows and review expectations.

If you have ideas or want to help, open an issue on the repositoryï¿½collaboration is encouraged!
